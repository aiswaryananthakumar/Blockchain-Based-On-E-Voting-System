1. Install MongoDB Compass
2. Create a connection named as BLK
3. Create a database named as BLK
4. Import the BLK.wallets collection in the BLK database

5. Do all the other steps as usual

6. Need to register on first launch of --node index.js--

7. Then Log in with the registered credentials.

8. Use the walletID and RefNo in the 'wallets' collection.

walletID: 0x9876543210abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678
refNo: VOTE123456


**Need to upgrade this project to detect duplicate walletids and refnos. Work in Progress on that part.**
